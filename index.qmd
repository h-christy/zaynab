## Abstract

## Introduction


On what basis can we talk about an "Islamic Revival", "Islamic Radicalization"? What evidence can allow us to indicate an emerging support for political Islam from the mass in the 1980s?

- The coming up of new ideas, new political thinkings and new imagination of communities which Islam played a significant role.

- The rapid growth of members and geograohical coverage of Muslim Brotherhood as a movement.

- The most direct evidence probably is that the Islamist, or the Islamic political parties were doing well in elections.[@garnhamDemocracyWarPeace1995]

## Literature Review

#### Mark Tessler and 

The study that I hope to revisit is[@tesslerOriginsPopularSupport1997]


#### Steven Brooke and Neil Ketchley

This study took on an innovative approach for a historical understanding the origins of Politcal Islam in inter-war (1937-1945) Egypt.

One way that we can talk about the increasing popular support for Islamist movements in the middle East and to find an explanation for that social phenomenon[@brookeSocialInstitutionalOrigins2018, dataverse]

#### Theories

1. Olivier Roy: born Muslim again in the west, suggesting that political islam has to do with East-West encounters
2. A creative response to Modernity: modern (western) education gave them the ability of becoming some of the strongest critics of modern western society (Sayyid Qutb)
3. A going back that is disrupting the grain of history that they expect should have continued to progress toward their values. Against the grain, not enlightened.

Some of the theories that we would not want to adopt as we believe that there are ways of looking at this history that would be..

The end of history, the clash of civilization, the new world order.

### Evidence

**1988 Jamal al-Suwaidi Survey Data**

This survey was carried out in mid-1988, with samples drawfrom Cairo and Kuwait, targeting the urban Sunni adults: Egyptians (n = 292), Kuwaitis (n = 300)and Palestinians residing in Kuwait at that time (n = 293).[@garnhamDemocracyWarPeace1995, pp. 164-166]

The data available on ICPSR *Carnegie Middle East Governance and Islam Dataset, 1988-2014 (ICPSR 32302)* only includes only the Egyptian and Kuwaiti sample, the Palestinian sample is not present.[@tesslerCarnegieMiddleEast2016a]
